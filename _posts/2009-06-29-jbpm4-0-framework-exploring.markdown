I just finished a 0.1 version of [jBPM 4.0 framework exploring](http://people.apache.org/%7Ejeffyu/articles/zh_CN/jbpm/) , it is written in Chinese, I would say the jbpm4.0 framework is very neat, and easy to understand, it is very flexible.

So, if you are looking for a good BPM library, then I would strongly recommend that try out the jBPM 4.0, whose GA will be supposed to be released at July 1st.

If you have any comments on the article, you can leave your comments here. ;-)
