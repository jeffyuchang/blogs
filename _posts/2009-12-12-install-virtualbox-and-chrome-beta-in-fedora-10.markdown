Just installed the VirtualBox in my Fedora 10 box by following [this blog entry](http://randell.ph/geeky/2009/03/27/install-windows-xp-sp2-via-sun-virtualbox-in-fedora-10/). It works great. If you live in China, you know you have to use MS's Internet Explore in some cases, like online bank. So it would be neat that having a virtual box, and having a Windoows installed.  Noticed that google roll out the [linux version of Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), althought it is just beta version, tried it, looked good.
