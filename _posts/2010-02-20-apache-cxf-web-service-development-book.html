I was invited to review the new book about <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache CXF</a> from packtpub, it is called《<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/apache-cxf-web-service-development/book">Apache CXF Web Service Development</a>》by <a title="Naveen Balani" href="http://www.packtpub.com/author_view_profile/id/410">Naveen Balani</a> and                     <a title="Rajeev Hathi" href="http://www.packtpub.com/author_view_profile/id/411">Rajeev Hathi</a>.

From the table of content, it covers both web service and restful service in CXF, also had three chapters for the CXF's frontend, transport, interceptors, invoke etc, which are the essential concepts of CXF's architecture. So it definitely seems interesting to me. I will post more detailed review once I finished the book.
