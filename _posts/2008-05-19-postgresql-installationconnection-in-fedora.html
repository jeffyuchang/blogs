Because I wan to try the <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/jbosson">JON 2.0</a>, I gotta have a database, currently the JON supports two databases, Postgres and Oracle. So here I choose the Postgres as it is open source.

I am using the Fedora8, so install the postgres just simply need to run
<blockquote>yum install postgresql-server</blockquote>
After I installed the postgres, I created it with following command:
<blockquote>service postgresql initdb
service postgresql start</blockquote>
And then I try to (as reference[1] described)
<blockquote>createuser -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -S -D -R rhqadmin</blockquote>
it tells me that " FATAL:  Ident authentication failed for user "postgres". This error mostly means you need to update the "pg_hba.conf" file.

try to run
<blockquote>ps aux | grep postmaster</blockquote>
to find out where the "pg_hba.conf" located. (Here thanks to illya77 and pilhuhn in #rhq at irc.freenode.net help me solve this problem).

Update the pg_hba.conf  suggested, and then

Edit the postgres host based access configuration file (pg_hba.conf), which typically would be at: /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

Modify the local line to use "trust" based authentication rather than "identity". Please review the PostgreSQL documentation before making this change and take the security
<pre>local all  all   trust</pre>
After that, restart the postgresql to make the change taking effect.
<blockquote>service postgresql restart</blockquote>
At last: run
<blockquote>psql -h localhost -U postgres</blockquote>
to see if it can log in.
