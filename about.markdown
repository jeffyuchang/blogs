---

I am a coder - programmer, mainly using the [Java Language](http://java.sun.com) for many years. I started programming from building the static HTML pages, and then the dynamic pages using ASP. After graduation, I started working on building enterprise software (Browser/Server based) by using Java in various domains, Finance, Government Automation etc. 

In 2007, I Joined the IONA, started working on SOA related projects and offically started working on open source projects, like Apache CXF, Apache ServiceMix. Later I moved to work for JBoss/Red Hat, still focus on SOA area, in projects like Web Service, ESB, BPM, Process Governance etc, and still work in open source way.

I am interested in many areas, such as the Programming Languages, (namely Functional Programming, like Haskell, Clojure, Scala etc), Big Data, Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence and Operating System, I strongly believed the AI will be the next big thing in the future.
